Awake in a state of holding onto time
Looking ahead and I can't open my eyes
Keeping myself from living today twice
Looking ahead and I can't open my eyes

Don't wanna stay, get away
Living for the little things these days
Catch up to the bigger dreams, not yet
Yeah I gotta find my way, they say

I don't wanna stay, get away
Living for the little things these days
Catch up to the bigger dreams, not yet
Yeah I gotta find my way, they say

I don't wanna stay...
